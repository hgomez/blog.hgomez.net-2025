I used [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) and [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.

## Setup started

I installed latest Hugo Extended with mise.dev

````
mise use --global hugo-extended@0.153.4
````

As of 0.146, Hugo is much more regarding in format and I had to reworks things a bit
